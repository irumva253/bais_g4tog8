        <p>
          Bright Angels International School (BAIS) was founded in 2013 as a daycare facility in Nyarutarama-Kigali City in Rwanda. In 2014 a nursery section was added. BAIS mission was to create a safe and nurturing learning environment where children could receive the highest quality of care.
          <br>
          Subsequently, due to its good reputation and its uniqueness in caring for young children with love and kindness and the increasing demand for more high-quality education and discipline, the primary school section was opened in 2018.

          Our pioneer G6 students sat for the Cambridge Assessment International Examinations' primary checkpoint exams in April 2022. Our results were amazingly excellent. Our pioneer candidates performed well above the international average in Maths, Science as well as English; with many students scoring maximum points in all subjects.
        </p>

        <p>
          In 2022, the school extended its intake to Lower Secondary in order to enable a smooth transition from primary to secondary school. Today, Bright Angels International School is a bilingual school, teaching English and  French and offering Cambridge and DELF exams. This enables us to provide educational experiences of an international standard. 
          The curriculum used by BAIS aims to stimulate the power of imagination, independent thinking, analytical minds, and problem-solving, while concurrently giving education on lifeâ€™s values. Bright Angels is proud of its staff, who possess a combination of proven experience, qualifications, certifications, and dedication to the teaching profession, along with a global perspective. 
          Teachers are carefully selected, trained and supported in order to maximize their potential, and they regularly engage in capacity building activities to keep their skills up to date.
